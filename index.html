                            Visual metaphors, which are widely used in graphic design, can deliver messages in creative
                            ways by fusing different objects. The keys to creating visual metaphors are diverse
                            exploration and creative combinations, which is challenging with conventional methods like
                            image searching. To streamline this ideation process, we propose to use a mind-map-like
                            structure to recommend and assist users to explore materials. We present MetaMap, a
                            supporting tool which inspires visual metaphor ideation through multi-dimensional
                            example-based exploration. To facilitate the divergence and convergence of the ideation
                            process, MetaMap provides 1) sample images based on keyword association and color filtering;
                            2) example-based exploration in semantics, color, and shape dimensions; and 3) thinking path
                            tracking and idea recording. We conduct a within-subject study with 24 design enthusiasts by
                            taking a Pinterest-like interface as the baseline. Our evaluation results suggest that
                            MetaMap provides an engaging ideation process and helps participants create diverse and
                            creative ideas.

                            <p>To facilitate divergence and convergence activities in the ideation process, MetaMap
                                provides 1) assembly of image search results based on automatic keyword association and
                                color theme filtering; 2) exploration of examples related to a seed image from
                                semantics, color, and shape dimensions; and 3) support for thinking paths tracking and
                                ideas recording. The conventional image searching process is supported by word
                                association to inspire users with more concepts. After identifying an image of interest,
                                users can further explore the recommendation exemplars based on 3-dimensional features:
                                semantics, color, and shape. Users can save useful images and type comments to record
                                their thoughts before a new brainstorming iteration. All the saved mind maps and images
                                record the thinking path generated by users for a quick recollection.

                                    many such people). Workers do not have "faces" or "expressions". They are all working
                                    overtime to produce their own "masks" and to produce themselves in adult society. The "face"
                                    needed. They are not really happy, but treat life as a mechanized and rigid activity. I hope
                                    this will arouse everyone's attention to the pursuit of life's interest and true happiness.
